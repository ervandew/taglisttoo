Prerequisites                                    *taglisttoo-prerequisites*

TaglistToo requires the following:

1. Exuberant Ctags to be installed: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/
2. Vim 7.x
3. Python support compiled into (g)vim

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview                                         *taglisttoo-overview*

TaglistToo is a plugin which provides an outline of the current source file in
a separate window allowing you to quickly see the classes, methods, functions,
etc available and to jump to them quickly. This plugin is very similar to the
excellent taglist[1] plugin written by Yegappan Lakshmanan. The motivation
for creating an alternative to the hugely popular taglist plugin is that the
original was written prior to vim 7.0 and so was forced to use data structures
which are very difficult to work with to hold and display the tag information.
These data structures make it hard to customize taglist, so TaglistToo aims to
provide similar functionality but leveraging vim 7.0+ lists and dictionaries
to hold tag information and providing hooks allowing you to customize the
resulting taglist window's layout and to add support for new file types not
natively supported by ctags.

Here is a list of enhancements vs unimplemented features from which to compare
TaglistToo to the original taglist.vim:

Enhancements not found in the original taglist:

- Supports an extension mechanism allowing the taglist display to be
  customized by file type.
- Provides custom displays for a handful of languages (java, javascript, php,
  python, etc.) which groups methods and variables by object/class for easier
  viewing and navigation.
- Supports denoting tags based on their visibility (+public, -private,
  *static, #protected).
- Provides the ability to add support for new file types not supported by
  ctags.
- Echoing of the current tag while scrolling through the taglist window, which
  is helpful if the tag name doesn't fit in the width of taglist window.

Unimplemented features found in the original taglist:

- Drop down list in gvim with the list of tags.
- Tag re-sorting
- Support for tags for more than one file in the taglist window.
- ... possibly others.

Other than the feature differences the behavior of TaglistToo is very similar
to the original taglist.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage                                            *taglisttoo-usage*
                                                 *:TlistToo*

To open the taglist window simply run the command :TlistToo. As long as the
current file type is supported and exists on disk, the taglist window will
open and display an outline of the file. Executing :TlistToo again will close
the taglist window.

Within the taglist window you can jump to a particular tag in the source file
by hitting <Enter> on the tag.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration                                    *taglisttoo-configuration*

In an attempt to make your transition from the original taglist to TaglistToo
as easy as possible, TaglistToo supports a some of the same configuration
variables:

- *g:Tlist_Ctags_Cmd* - Sets the location or your ctags executable (if not
  set, TaglistToo will try to find either exuberant-ctags or ctags on your
  path).
- *g:Tlist_Auto_Open* (Default: 0) - When non-zero, the taglist will auto open
  at vim startup if the file type is supported.
- *g:Tlist_WinWidth* (Default: 30) - Sets the width of the taglist window.
- *g:Tlist_Sort_Type* (Default: 'name') - Determines how the tags should be
  sorted in the taglist window. When set to 'name', the tags will be sorted
  alphabetically, but when set to 'order' the tags will be sorted by their
  occurrence in the source file.
- *g:TagList_title* (Default: '[TagList]') - Sets the name of the taglist
  window.
- g:Tlist_Use_Right_Window - Preferably you should set the
  |g:TaglistTooPosition| variable, but for compatibility with the original
  taglist, if this variable is set to a non-0 value then
  |g:TaglistTooPosition| will be set to 'right'.

Some TaglistToo specific variables:

- *g:TaglistTooEnabled* (Default: 1) - When set to 0 this disables loading of
  TaglistToo.
- *g:TaglistTooPosition* (Default: 'left') - This determines whether the
  taglist window will be opened on the left or right side of vim. Supported
  values include 'left' and 'right'.
- *g:TaglistTooTagEcho* (Default: 1) - When set to a non 0 value, when moving
  the cursor in the taglist window, the name of the tag under the cursor will
  be echoed to the vim command line.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extending / Customizing                          *taglisttoo-customization*

For compatibility with the original taglist, TagListToo supports the same
g:tlist_{ft}_settings variables including the string format: >

    let g:tlist_mylang_settings = 'mylang;t:mytype;f:myfield'
>

However, since vim 7 and above has support for lists and dictionaries, the
above setting can be expressed for TaglistToo as follows: >

    let g:tlist_mylang_settings = {
        \ 'lang': 'mylang',
        \ 'tags': {
          \ 't': 'mytype',
          \ 'f': 'myfield',
        \ }
      \ }
>

The one character keys in the 'tags' dictionary are what will be passed to
ctags --<lang>-types argument, and the value for those keys is the text to be
displayed in the taglist window.

Parsing New File Types:                          *taglisttoo-parse*

The default method for which TaglistToo obtains the list of tags for a given
source file is to use ctags. If you want to add a new language which isn't
supported by ctags by default you generally have a couple options:

1. You can define a new language via regular expression patterns in your
   .ctags file using the langdef, langmap, and --regex-<lang> options.
2. You can write a C extension to ctags.

The first approach, while fairly simple, is a bit limiting. The most
frustrating limitation is that the file to be parse is processed one line at a
time, which prevents you from identifying tags that span two or more lines.

For example, given the following web.xml file, you would not be able to
distinguish between the first block which is a servlet definition, and the
second which is a servlet mapping, because you would need to process the parent
tag, not just the servlet-name tag: >

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.foo.MyServlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>/my-servlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet-mapping>
>

The second approach, is much more flexible, but writing a language processor in
C may not be a feasible solution for various reasons (unfamiliarity with C,
portability, etc.).

Taking into account these concerns, TaglistToo provides the means to add new
languages by allowing you to configure a vim script function to be executed to
obtain the tags. In this function you can process the file however you would
like, but TaglistToo provides a simple utility function allowing you to supply
a list of tag types, python compatible regular expressions, and the
replacement text or group used to obtain the tag name.

Here is an example function which processes the web.xml file described above: >

  function! ParseWebXml(file, settings)
    return taglisttoo#util#Parse(a:file, [
        \ ['s', '<servlet\s*>\s*<servlet-name\s*>\s*(.*?)\s*</servlet-name\s*>', 1],
        \ ['m', '<servlet-mapping\s*>\s*<servlet-name\s*>\s*(.*?)\s*</servlet-name\s*>', 1],
      \ ])
  endfunction
>

There are a couple things to note about how these regular expressions are
evaluated:

1. When compiling the regular expression the DOTALL and MULTILINE flags are
   always set.
2. The regular expressions are executed against the whole file at once.
3. If you would like to have the IGNORECASE flag set as well, simply add a
   'i' as a fourth value to each list where you'd like that flag enabled.
4. The third value in each list specifies what replacement value should be
   used to extract the tag name from the matched text. If the value is an int,
   it is interpreted as the group number from the regular expression.  If the
   value is a string, then a separate substitution is executed with that
   value.  So if you had two groups you wanted to combine, you could supply
   '\1 \2' for the third value in the supplied list.

Now that you have a function which processes the file, you simply need to
configure the taglist settings for the webxml file type: >

  let g:tlist_webxml_settings = {
      \ 'lang': 'webxml',
      \ 'parse': 'ParseWebXml',
      \ 'tags': {
        \ 's': 'servlet',
        \ 'm': 'servlet-mapping'
      \ }
    \ }
>

Notice the new 'parse' key introduced here which tells TaglistToo to use that
function instead of the default one.

Note: This example introduces a new file type, webxml, which doesn't exist by
default in vim, so if you want to test this out on a real web.xml file you'll
need to manually set the file type (:set ft=webxml).

Customizing taglist contents:                    *taglisttoo-format*

In addition to parsing new file types, you can also customize the taglist
format for new or existing file types. To do so you simply tell TaglistToo to
use a different format function. Here is an example using TagListToo's python
settings: >

  let g:tlist_python_settings = {
      \ 'lang': 'python',
      \ 'format': 'taglisttoo#lang#python#Format',
      \ 'tags': {
        \ 'c': 'class',
        \ 'm': 'member',
        \ 'f': 'function'
      \ }
    \ }
>

Instead of using the default format, TaglistToo will invoke the
taglisttoo#lang#python#Format function which in this case will group members
and functions by the class they are defined in and any global functions will
be displayed at the top of the taglist window.

Unfortunately, implementing a function which customizes the taglist layout is
not as straight forward and writing one which parses a new file type. If you
wish to write one of these format functions, currently you are best off
copying one of the format functions defined in one of the
autoload/taglisttoo/lang/<lang>.vim files and customizing it to your needs.
Hopefully future versions of TaglistToo will make writing these easier.
